# Auto Word Suggestions Component

## Overview
I created a React component to provide auto word suggestions as a user types into an input field. This can be useful for enhancing the user experience in applications where users need assistance or quick suggestions while typing.

## How It Works

### Input Field
The component includes an input field where users can type.

### State Management
I used React's `useState` hook to manage two state variables:
- `inputText`: Stores the text entered into the input field.
- `suggestions`: Keeps track of an array of word suggestions.

### Input Change Handling
The `handleInputChange` function is triggered whenever the user types in the input field. It updates the `inputText` state and generates word suggestions based on the entered text.

### Suggestion Click Handling
The `handleSuggestionClick` function is called when a user clicks on a suggestion. It sets the input text to the clicked suggestion and clears the suggestions list.

### Generate Suggestions Function
The `generateSuggestions` function is a placeholder for the logic to generate word suggestions. In this example, it uses a static list of suggestions and filters them based on the input text.

### Rendering JSX
The component renders an input field and a list of suggestions dynamically. Suggestions are updated as the user types, and clicking on a suggestion updates the input field.

## Why It Matters
This component can be valuable in applications where users need assistance in typing or selecting relevant words. It's a user-friendly feature that enhances the overall experience.
